This is a personal project for the Artist Lara Mayan Bucek aka "Lara May"

Origional songs are included in the static/music file and can be downloaded for free.

All music was written, recorded, produced, and mixxed by Matthew Cano (me), lyrics by Lara May and Matthew Cano.

The project was based out of Austin Texas. 

Project was started in May of 2014 and was disbanded in May of 2016.

Website was live via a private server (raspberry pi) for a short time from 2015-2016.

I used PyCharm to edit and intially run, and then used the following command line to run:
$/Users/matthewcano/cs3320-env/bin/python /Users/matthewcano/PycharmProjects/Lara-May/Lara-May.py runserver --debug --reload

which is:
$ path to virtural enviroment path to the main .py file and command runserver with options debug and reload
